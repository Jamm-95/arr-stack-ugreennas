# Pi-hole local DNS configuration
#
# This placeholder file prevents Docker from creating a directory.
# For Core setup, it does nothing - Pi-hole works without custom DNS entries.
#
# For + local DNS setup, replace with:
#   sed "s/TRAEFIK_LAN_IP/YOUR_IP/g" pihole/02-local-dns.conf.example > pihole/02-local-dns.conf
#
# See docs/SETUP.md "Local DNS" section.
